jqGrid is an Ajax-enabled !JavaScript control that provides solutions for
representing and manipulating tabular data on the web. Since the grid is a
client-side solution loading data dynamically through Ajax callbacks, it can be
integrated with any server-side technology, including PHP, ASP, Java Servlets,
JSP, !ColdFusion, and Perl. For more read the [[%PUBURLPATH%/%SYSTEMWEB%/JQGridPlugin/jqgriddocs/][jqgriddocs]].

---++ Special columns

Normnally, the data and the way it is displayed in a GRID is specified by the !DataForm definition the GRID expression points to.
However, there's a set of additional properties of a topic that can be displayed in a GRID. These are specified in the =columns=
parameter to %GRID and are mapped to the actual property as follows: 

| *Colname* | *Data* | *Displayed* |
| Topic | topic name | link to topic |
| Modified, Changed | time when the topic has been changed recently | standard date format |
| By, Author | author of the last modification | link to author's homepage |
| Image, Photo | formfields of that name | displayed as html &lt;img> tag where the data is used as src link ||

When [[Foswiki:Extensions/FlexFormPlugin][FlexFormPlugin]] is installed, each cell is rendered using
=%RENDERFORDISPLAY= expression.

When [[Foswiki:Extesions/ImagePlugin][ImagePlugin]] is installed, each Image/Photo cell is renderd using an
=%IMAGE= expression to render thumbnails.

%RED%
WARNING: This part is still in flux and solved rather adhoc for now. 
The way how to specify which data is displayed in which way per column is still
subject to further changes.
