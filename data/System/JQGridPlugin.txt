jqGrid is an Ajax-enabled !JavaScript control that provides solutions for
representing and manipulating tabular data on the web. Since the grid is a
client-side solution loading data dynamically through Ajax callbacks, it can be
integrated with any server-side technology, including PHP, ASP, Java Servlets,
JSP, !ColdFusion, and Perl. For more read the [[%PUBURLPATH%/%SYSTEMWEB%/JQGridPlugin/jqgriddocs/][jqgriddocs]].

---++ Special columns

Normally, the data and the way it is displayed in a GRID is specified by the !DataForm definition the GRID expression points to.
However, there's a set of additional properties of a topic that can be displayed in a GRID. These are specified in the =columns=
parameter to %GRID and are mapped to the actual property as follows:

| *Colname* | *Data* | *Displayed* |
| Topic | topic name | link to topic |
| Modified, Changed | time when the topic has been changed recently | standard date format |
| By, Author | author of the last modification | link to author's homepage |
| Image, Photo | formfields of that name | displayed as html &lt;img&gt; tag where the data is used as src link ||
When [[Foswiki:Extensions/FlexFormPlugin][FlexFormPlugin]] is installed, each cell is rendered using
=%RENDERFORDISPLAY= expression.

When [[Foswiki:Extesions/ImagePlugin][ImagePlugin]] is installed, each Image/Photo cell is renderd using an
=%IMAGE= expression to render thumbnails.
